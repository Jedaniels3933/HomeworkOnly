# Intro to for loops
# allow us ot execute a code block for every item in an [] interable



#Number of times can be repeated determined by the number of items in the iterable
# Syntax

#for item in iterable:  

#flavors = ['vanilla', 'chocolate', 'cookies n cream', 'caramel','orange sherbet']

#for item in flavors:#flavor is a variable that will hold the value of the current item in the list- can be anything 
    #print("Running the loop")
    #print(flavors)

# The loop will run 5 times, once for each flavor in the list as we loop over an iterable can loop over each item and do something or not
